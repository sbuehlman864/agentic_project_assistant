T001,Set up project scaffold and SPA shell,infra,P0,8.0,,"Project scaffold created with a modular folder structure and a minimal SPA shell. | Index.html loads and the app bootstraps without errors. | Basic npm scripts (install, start) work locally and serve the app. | Routing and module layout anticipate future features."
T002,Define data models for Course and SyllabusItem,data,P0,6.0,T001,"Data models for Course and SyllabusItem are defined with fields (e.g., id, name, startDate, syllabusItems). | Type definitions (TypeScript interfaces or JSDoc) enforce consistent shapes. | Sample in-memory data structures illustrate expected usage."
T003,Implement LocalStorage persistence layer,infra,P0,6.0,T001,"Persistence layer provides save and load functions for the app state. | Data is serialized to JSON and stored under a stable key in localStorage. | On startup, state is restored from localStorage with graceful handling of empty storage."
T004,Create initial UI to create and list courses,frontend,P0,10.0,T001;T003,UI allows creating a new course with name and optional start date. | UI lists existing courses loaded from localStorage. | Selecting a course updates the view to reflect the chosen course. | All UI interactions are client-side with no server dependency.
T005,"Add syllabus item entry UI (title, week, due date, description)",frontend,P1,6.0,T004,"Form fields exist for syllabus item: title, week number, due date, description. | UI validates required fields and provides inline errors when missing. | Submitting adds the syllabus item to the selected course and updates downstream weekly plans."
T006,Implement week mapping logic to generate weekly plans,data,P1,8.0,T005,Syllabus items are mapped to their corresponding calendar weeks. | A weekly plan data structure is generated and kept in sync with syllabus items. | Changes to syllabus items reflow into updated weekly plans.
T007,Implement validation for syllabus item entry,frontend,P1,4.0,T005,Inline validation messages appear for missing or invalid fields. | Submit is blocked until all required fields are valid. | Validation logic covers positive week numbers and valid date formats.
T008,Auto-persist changes to localStorage on data changes,data,P1,5.0,T007,Any change to courses or syllabus items triggers automatic save to localStorage. | No manual save button is required for MVP. | Reloading the page restores the latest changes.
T009,Build weekly planner view with tasks grouped by week,frontend,P0,12.0,T003;T004,Weekly view displays weeks with corresponding tasks grouped under each week. | Tasks show essential details such as title and due date. | Multiple courses can be reflected in the weekly view when selected.
T010,Implement task completion toggles and per-course progress,frontend,P0,6.0,T009,"Each task can be marked complete/incomplete via a toggle. | Per-course progress is calculated and displayed (e.g., percentage complete). | Progress UI updates automatically as tasks are toggled."
T011,Add course filter to weekly planner view,frontend,P0,6.0,T009,A course filter allows viewing tasks for a single course in the weekly view. | Filter selection is preserved within the session and resets appropriately.
T012,Ensure auto-save of progress and changes to localStorage,data,P0,8.0,T008;T010,Toggling a task or updating course details auto-saves to localStorage. | Reloading preserves completed states and edits. | No data loss occurs during rapid user interactions.
T013,Add export to JSON and CSV for all courses/plans,data,P1,6.0,T012,Export feature outputs a valid JSON file containing all courses and weekly plans. | CSV export is available and represents the same data structure. | Export files can be re-imported via the Import feature.
T014,Add import from JSON/CSV to restore plans,data,P1,6.0,T013,Import accepts JSON and CSV files with a valid schema. | Imported data replaces or merges with existing state per defined behavior. | Invalid formats produce a clear error message.
T015,Implement duplication of a course plan,frontend,P1,4.0,T014,"User can duplicate an existing course, creating a new course with the same structure. | Syllabus items in the duplicate are copied with new IDs and persisted. | Original course remains unchanged."
T016,Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation,frontend,P1,8.0,T009;T010,"All interactive elements are keyboard accessible with proper focus order. | ARIA attributes added for inputs, regions, and dynamic content. | Visible focus indicators and screen-reader friendly labels are present."
T017,Optimize initial load performance (target < 2s),frontend,P1,6.0,T016,"Performance measurements show initial load time under 2 seconds on typical desktop hardware. | Code paths minimized for first render (e.g., lazy loading where appropriate)."
T018,Add onboarding flow or sample demo data,frontend,P1,6.0,T017,Onboarding flow or sample demo course is available to enable quick-start planning. | Demo data can be cleared or reset easily.
T019,Polish UI/UX with microcopy and visual polish,frontend,P2,5.0,T018,"UI includes consistent typography, spacing, and clarifying microcopy. | Tooltips or inline hints assist user actions without clutter."
T020,Create testing plan and lightweight automated tests,testing,P2,4.0,T019,"A basic testing plan documents core flows (course creation, syllabus entry, mapping, persistence, export/import). | At least a small set of automated tests or a plan for manual tests exists to validate MVP behavior."
